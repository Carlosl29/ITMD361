		<!--Cooking-->
		<p>I'm a fan of food and eating in general, so cooking seemed like a no brainer to learn.  At first it was more of just wanting to be self-sustaining.  By that I mean, being able to live on my own and not have to need anyone else.</p>
		<p>Cooking was an easy skill to take up, since I already knew that I liked food.  Slowly over the years I've been learning how to cook.  How to pair flavors with each others, what works as a substitute for something else, and how to make simple recipes better with a few ingrediants.</p>
		<p>One of those foods that I've made better is Ramen.  I've taken regular Ramen noodles and added pickled cabbage, carrot and onion, a fried egg, sauteed ham, a splash of soy size, and green chives.  Best bowl of ramen noodles that I have ever had at home.</p>
